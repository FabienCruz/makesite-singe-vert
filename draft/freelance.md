<!-- title: my journey to become a freelancer -->
<!-- author: Le singe vert -->
I left a secure position in a big company to become a freelancer. I guess you'll find a lot of articles about it: a mixture of anger, boredom and fear called mid-life crisis.

I made a break where I have done some learning bootcamps in UX/UI and webdevelopment. I understood that It will be difficult to be accepted as a boomer among youngsters in the start-ups. Anyway those skills need practice and to be honest I like to code.

My purpose is clear and not very original: build my blog to practice and display my new skills on web development.

# made a break
First, I needed a break. Even if staying on my sofa and watching seasons changing through my window appealed to me, a lot of people advised me: "after 6 months" you'll be "out of the rythm", "brain damaged" and "drifting and soft as a jellyfish".

I had time and money. Able to live 2 years with unemployement benefits. So I enrolled to bootcamps.

# realized that I'm a "boomer" even if I am not
I have always considered my parents born after the second world war as "baby boomer". That generation grew up in the 60s listening to rock'n'roll, Elvis Prestley and the Beatles, had 'transistor' - radio, were hippies, loved cars and motorbikes, and so on. Some even lived some "revolution" in 1968, being communist was cool above all if you look like Che Guevarra. 

I am born in 1973. I am the generation born with the oil crisis, grew up with punk and new wave, Michael Jackson and Madonna, a walkman was my best christmas gift ever, saw the Berlin wall falled on tv, saw factories shut-down in real, unmemployement was our "no future", we had the first personnal computers in schools but my studies had finished when Internet really started. Some called us ["generation X - the lost generation"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_X), I feel quite confortable with it.

But people born in the 1990s consider us as "boomer".

I understood that It will be difficult to be accepted as a boomer among youngsters in the start-ups.

# time has effect
I enrolled to some UX/UI and web developpment bootcamps. I finished washed-out and with a lower self confidence. 

I discovered that I was not as fast and enduring as I thought.


# define a positionning


# get a 1st mission
my network is quite weak. I have worked for 16 years in the same company so that is where my network is. I don't want to go back there.

## try the platforms
You need a profile on linkedIn but it is not enough. There are plenty of [platform](https://independant.io/plateforme-freelance/). However, the quality is very different.
[Malt](https://www.malt.fr/) is the #1 but I received 0 contact with it. Maybe, my profile is not good.
I use [Freelance Info](https://www.freelance-info.fr/). I found it more efficient. I got 5 calls the first month to
