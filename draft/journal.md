## idea of journaling
For a long time, I didn't like the idea of journaling. It is linked to some romantic private diary picture. Don't like to explore and expose my intimacy. Finally, I'll give it a try much on a log book perspective. I try to learn things: becoming a freelancer and learning to code.

## french or english ?
Will I continue to write in english or turn back to french? Will I ever be able to do it in in italian ?

## idea of a log book application
with post-its functionnality a bit like trello.
