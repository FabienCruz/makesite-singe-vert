<!-- title: As a self-learning developper, how I lost motivation and how I've found it back -->
<!-- author: Le singe vert --> 
It is difficult to stay motivated a long time when learning a programming language by yourself. There are some traps.

I've started learning code 10 months ago. I am sharing my experience with all the mistakes I've done, so far, and some of the rescues I’ve found.

## The trap of the doubt: am I studying the right thing?

### I start to learn Ruby on Rails
I've done a bootcamp where Ruby on Rails is the main tool. It gave me a comprehensive view of what is possible. After a few weeks, we built a web application searching based on gmail API. Great, isn't?

I heard a lot that the programming language you learn does not really matter, as many concepts are similar (variables, iteration, loops, etc). What is important is to stick with one to get savvy enough and then you can start to learn another one.

However, I felt I was not learning the good programming language.

#### How the worm of the doubt enters in the apple
I spend a lot of time reading about the most popular programming language. It's amazing how much things are written on that subject.

You get some famous ranking billboards on [tiobe](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) and [stackoverflow](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#most-popular-technologies).

At the end, for a first language, the choice is not so spread:
- Javascript
- PHP
- Java
- Python
- C / C++

The point of view of this recruiter ([ignite.digital](https://www.ignite.digital/10-best-programming-languages-to-learn-in-2020/)) summarizes a bunch of articles:

> For beginners, Python and JavaScript are easy-to-learn and offer a huge market opportunity.
> 
> In the corporate world, Java and PHP are hot tickets.

It raises doubt about while learning Ruby on Rails.

#### I still need stabilizers on my bike
In the bootcamp, you get helped by teachers when you are stuck. When you are alone, it is different, you need support in an other way.

That's why tutorials are popular. They give a track to follow.

In my opinion, Ruby lacks beginner support compared to other programming language. A fast check using [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) search engine, the famous tutorials platform: "ruby" gets 609 results while "Python" or "Javascript" get more than 10 000 results.

Ruby on Rails is not outdated at all, it is even a pionnier on many points, but **it's like learning to drive with a Porsche**.

During the bootcamp, we had a bit of Javascript because when you do web development, you have to use Javascript. So I decide to learn it.

## The trap of drowning: the tutorial fatigue.
I registered to some tutorial. It's not expensive (some are free). It's cut in short pieces. You have timeline and milestones. It gives the sensation of going hiking with a map and good shoes.

So I learned things I already knew, but I didn't want to miss any point. The tutorials had project but they didn't really interested me. I mainly copy and paste.

**After some time, I've got bored. It is not a problem, it is a sign that It is time to step up.**

### the limits of tutorials

I quote this [great article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-python-the-easy-way/) about learning a programming language through tutorials: 
> I was also making another big mental mistake. I was thinking about learning Python in very black-and-white terms. Either I had “learned Python” — all of Python — or I had not.
>This made the prospect of learning really intimidating. Whenever I hit a challenge, it was made worse by the fact that I was thinking about some mythical Python “finish line” that was still very, very far away.

[Here](https://medium.com/better-programming/7-ways-to-actually-learn-something-from-coding-tutorials-b6cdddace26f)are some other great advices on how to use tutorials. The author makes the same observation:
>As a new dev, trying to learn the fundamentals feels like swimming in a deep ocean — and there’s no horizon in sight.

### take some air and think about what I like to do
The good question is what do I want to build, what skill do I want to get? After the bootcamp and the tutorial, my ideas are more clear. I can be more very specific and imagine something I would be proud of. A blog? A card game? A robot which will water my plants? Don't try to be original and too ambitious. Practice makes perfect.

**The most important thing is to get quick satisfaction just like when you succeed to build an IKEA furniture.**

[Here](https://vanillawebprojects.com/) is a site to get ideas.

I don't want to specialize in web development. Because I don't like to specialize, I'm more of a generalist person. I'd like to build my blog, make an API that display silly jokes, deal with files and automate tasks, do data visualization, touch a bit of machine learning... and I suck in front-end design.

By the way, I did this [quizz](https://www.bestprogramminglanguagefor.me/q) to help to find the programming language that fit me.

And I've start to learn Python!
